This is the code used for creating my Full Stack assignment. This includes the front-end and back-end of the system.
In the backend, I was given starter code which created the API using NodeJS. I was then required to create each end-point for my system.
These end points were used in the front-end, which is all my original code. I used Vue to utilise my JavaScript and Bootstrap to style it.

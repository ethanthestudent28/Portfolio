This is my web development assignment from the first year of university. Although the website is quite basic, I feel it important to show how my skills have developed over my time as a student. This website is front-end only, with very basic designs for each webpage, and an unfinished request sent to an API. 
To see my current level of skill, please view my Full stack assignment here: https://github.com/ethanthestudent28/Portfolio/tree/main/Full%20stack%20website
